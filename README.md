# Combinator 3000

Audio graph generator for multi-environment combination.
Experimental / in development.

## Mechanism 

Main component is `node`. A Node is an audio processor. 
It has :

    - A number of inputs and outputs
    - An output buffer for samples processing (input buffer is always owned by previous node)
    - A `process` method (compute)
    - A vector of `connection` (represent output connections
    - A `connect` method to connect a node to another

Nodes can be put in a `graph` object or a `rtgraph`. 
A `graph` handles a list of `node` (starting of chain) and generates an internal list of events to trigger, 
automatically finding which node is connected to which. 
Nodes must be connected together BEFORE the "starting node" of the chain is put in the graph.

## Dependencies 

Some nodes won't compile unless you have installed : 
- Faust (with libfaust and LLVM support)
- Csound 
- libsndfile

## TODO 

- Add Nodegroup - as a group that can contain several connected nodes that will share buffer 
- Move AudioFFT to copy rather than submodule (keep double version instead of float)
- Add "notify_node_in" method to node called when `connect` so each callee can know a bit about its caller BEFORE processing 
(so FFT OLA nodes could check that caller has small bloc size etc)

- Change to shared pointer as soon as possible 
- Graph drawing (add Faust graph generator)
- Optimizations in general
  - The graph class must have some optim to do
  - A general memory pool to allocate buffers (contiguous memory)
  - Memory allocator 
    - Add deallocator (free for the handler)
  - Find a mechanism to avoid buffer copy -> pointer based. 
    - graph could allocates memory for all nodes and gathers (when generating call list) how many memory it needs as well as how many different zones (each branch)
    - Then it could call each node with pointers to memory it needs (or give them the pointers at "init" time, when creating the graph)

  - In the `graph::process_bloc` function, while performing, it could gather information on nodes to optimize (in realtime) ? 
- Blocsize adapter (without resampling - could be implemented like a circular buffer)
- Thread safety and threading model 
  - Thread locks
  - Idea that several graphs could be used on separated threads to improve performance (taking advantage of several cores)

- Done - FFT node 
- Done - Faust LLVM node
- Done - Csound node
- Done - Sndfile node : still need to 
  - Add loop mode (optional)
  - Add change sndfile mode (through function)
  
- API to create external nodes (C++ or Faust) and build it (so API to link dynamic libraries at runtime)

- Buffer underrun when starting rtgraph
